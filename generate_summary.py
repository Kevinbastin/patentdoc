REAL PATENT EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention, there is provided an Internet of Things (IoT) based remote monitoring and alerting system for mitigating human-animal conflict, comprising:
a plurality of field-deployed sensor nodes, each sensor node comprising:
   at least one animal detection module;
   a microcontroller unit configured to process input from said animal detection module;
   an integrated wireless dual communication system comprising Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) module and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) module; and
   a deterrent unit configured to activate upon detection of an animal presence;
a central master node configured to receive detection data from said sensor nodes;
a cloud server; and
a power management unit,
   wherein the microcontroller unit is configured to execute machine learning or TinyML models,
   wherein the LoRaWAN module is prioritized for low-power transmission,
   wherein the GSM module acts as a fall back channel,
   and wherein a web server operates with a user-friendly interface.

It is another aspect of the present invention, wherein the sensor nodes are arranged in a mesh or star topology.

It is another aspect of the present invention, wherein the animal detection module is selected from PIR sensors, cameras, and acoustic sensors.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Start with: "Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention, there is provided..."
2. List main system with "comprising:" followed by components
3. Multiple "wherein" clauses (5-8)
4. Follow with 3-5 "It is another aspect..." statements
5. Length: 300-500 words

NOW WRITE (only text, no heading):

Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention, there is provided"""
