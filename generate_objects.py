REAL PATENT EXAMPLE STRUCTURE (Study this carefully):

OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION

One or more of the problems of the conventional prior arts may be overcome by various embodiments of the system and method of the present invention.

It is the primary object of the present invention to provide an Internet of Things (IoT) based remote monitoring and multi-modal alerting system using an integrated dual wireless communication system for human-animal conflict mitigation.

It is another object of the present invention to provide a hybrid monitoring and dual-communication system to ensure continuous data transmission, situational awareness, and real-time alerts in critical field environments.

It is another object of the present invention, wherein the IoT based remote monitoring and multi-modal alerting system integrates edge-based Artificial intelligence (AI) processing, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) technologies to deliver redundancy and high availability.

It is another object of the present invention, wherein the IoT based remote monitoring and multi-modal alerting system uses Raspberry Pi with TinyML for real-time accurate elephant detection at 97.1% accuracy together with multi-modal alerting through GSM, LoRaWAN modules and hybrid networking.

It is another object of the present invention, wherein the integrated dual-communication system for environmental monitoring provides dependable alerts across regions with weak network signals.

It is another object of the present invention, wherein the IoT based remote monitoring and multi-modal alerting system provides community-centric multi-modal alerting integrating both forest authorities and local villagers.

It is another object of the present invention, wherein the system as an all-in-one reliability system continues alerting functionality during single network breakdowns.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Write EXACTLY in this format:

   Paragraph 1: "One or more of the problems of the conventional prior arts may be overcome by various embodiments of the system and method of the present invention."

   Paragraph 2: "It is the primary object of the present invention to provide [complete description of main system with key technologies]."

   Paragraphs 3-9: "It is another object of the present invention, wherein [specific feature or benefit]."
   OR
   "It is another object of the present invention to provide [specific capability]."

2. Write 6-10 objects total (1 primary + 5-9 additional)

3. Each "another object" should describe:
   - A specific technical feature
   - A unique capability or benefit
   - Integration of technologies
   - Reliability or performance aspect
   - User-facing feature or outcome

4. Use formal patent language:
   - "It is the primary object..."
   - "It is another object..."
   - "wherein the [system]..."
   - "to provide..."

5. Include specific technologies from the abstract (IoT, AI, ML, sensors, communication protocols, etc.)

6. Each object should be 1-3 sentences, focused on ONE aspect

7. DO NOT use bullet points or numbered lists

8. DO NOT use marketing language (revolutionary, best, amazing, etc.)

9. BE SPECIFIC - mention exact technologies, modules, percentages if relevant
